## 1. CTE 개념과 정의

### 1.1 CTE란?

**CTE(Common Table Expression)**는 쿼리 내에서 **임시로 정의되는 가상 테이블**입니다.

- **기본 개념**: WITH 절을 사용하여 정의하는 임시 결과 집합
- **범위**: 단일 쿼리 실행 범위 내에서만 유효
- **가독성**: 복잡한 쿼리를 단순하고 읽기 쉽게 분해

### 1.2 CTE의 장점

```sql
-- CTE 사용 전 (복잡한 서브쿼리)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  total_amount,
  avg_amount
FROM (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount,
    AVG(amount) as avg_amount
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY customer_id
) subquery
WHERE total_amount > 1000;

-- CTE 사용 후 (명확하고 읽기 쉬운 구조)
WITH customer_summary AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount,
    AVG(amount) as avg_amount
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  total_amount,
  avg_amount
FROM customer_summary
WHERE total_amount > 1000;
```

### 1.3 CTE vs 서브쿼리 vs 뷰

| 구분 | CTE | 서브쿼리 | 뷰 |
|------|-----|----------|-----|
| **범위** | 단일 쿼리 | 단일 쿼리 | 전역 |
| **재사용** | 같은 쿼리 내 | 불가능 | 모든 쿼리 |
| **가독성** | 높음 | 낮음 | 높음 |
| **성능** | 최적화됨 | 최적화됨 | 뷰 정의에 따라 |

## 2. CTE 문법과 구조

### 2.1 기본 문법

```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
  -- CTE 정의 쿼리
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE conditions
)
-- 메인 쿼리
SELECT *
FROM cte_name
WHERE additional_conditions;
```

### 2.2 다중 CTE 문법

```sql
WITH 
  first_cte AS (
    SELECT customer_id, order_count
    FROM order_summary
    WHERE order_count > 5
  ),
  second_cte AS (
    SELECT customer_id, total_amount
    FROM payment_summary
    WHERE total_amount > 1000
  )
SELECT 
  f.customer_id,
  f.order_count,
  s.total_amount
FROM first_cte f
JOIN second_cte s
  ON f.customer_id = s.customer_id;
```

### 2.3 중첩 CTE

```sql
WITH 
  level1 AS (
    SELECT product_id, category_id, sales_amount
    FROM sales
    WHERE sale_date >= '2024-01-01'
  ),
  level2 AS (
    SELECT 
      category_id,
      COUNT(*) as product_count,
      SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales
    FROM level1
    GROUP BY category_id
  )
SELECT 
  category_id,
  product_count,
  total_sales,
  total_sales / product_count as avg_sales_per_product
FROM level2
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

---

## 3. CTE 종류와 특징

### 3.1 단순 CTE (Simple CTE)

**용도**: 복잡한 쿼리를 논리적 단위로 분해

```sql
-- 월별 매출 요약 CTE
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) as month,
    SUM(amount) as total_amount,
    COUNT(*) as order_count
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY year, month
)
SELECT 
  year,
  month,
  total_amount,
  order_count,
  total_amount / order_count as avg_order_value
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY year, month;
```

### 3.2 재귀 CTE (Recursive CTE)

**용도**: 계층 구조 데이터나 반복적인 연산 처리

```sql
-- 조직 계층 구조 조회
WITH RECURSIVE org_hierarchy AS (
  -- 앵커: 최상위 매니저
  SELECT 
    employee_id,
    employee_name,
    manager_id,
    1 as level,
    CAST(employee_name AS STRING) as path
  FROM employees
  WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- 재귀: 하위 직원들
  SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.employee_name,
    e.manager_id,
    oh.level + 1,
    CONCAT(oh.path, ' -> ', e.employee_name)
  FROM employees e
  JOIN org_hierarchy oh
    ON e.manager_id = oh.employee_id
  WHERE oh.level < 10  -- 무한 루프 방지
)
SELECT 
  employee_id,
  employee_name,
  level,
  path
FROM org_hierarchy
ORDER BY level, employee_name;
```

### 3.3 창 함수와 결합된 CTE

```sql
-- 고객별 구매 패턴 분석
WITH customer_purchases AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id 
      ORDER BY order_date
    ) as purchase_sequence,
    LAG(order_date) OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id 
      ORDER BY order_date
    ) as prev_order_date
  FROM orders
),
purchase_intervals AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    purchase_sequence,
    amount,
    DATE_DIFF(order_date, prev_order_date, DAY) as days_between_orders
  FROM customer_purchases
  WHERE prev_order_date IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_orders,
  AVG(amount) as avg_order_amount,
  AVG(days_between_orders) as avg_days_between_orders
FROM purchase_intervals
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
ORDER BY avg_order_amount DESC;
```

        ROUND((monthly_revenue - prev_month_revenue) / prev_month_revenue * 100, 2)
      ELSE NULL
    END as revenue_growth_rate,
    CASE

WHERE rank_in_category <= 5  -- 각 카테고리별 상위 5개 제품
ORDER BY category, rank_in_category;
```

## 5. CTE 최적화 전략

### 5.1 CTE 구체화 (Materialization)

BigQuery는 CTE를 자동으로 최적화하지만, 명시적으로 구체화를 제어할 수 있습니다.

```sql
-- 큰 CTE를 여러 번 참조할 때 구체화 힌트 사용
WITH 
  large_dataset AS (
    SELECT /*+ MATERIALIZE */ 
      customer_id,
      product_id,
      quantity,
      price,
      order_date
    FROM large_orders_table
    WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
      AND status = 'COMPLETED'
  ),
  customer_totals AS (
    SELECT 
      customer_id,
      SUM(quantity * price) as total_spent
    FROM large_dataset
    GROUP BY customer_id
  ),
  product_totals AS (
    SELECT 
      product_id,
      SUM(quantity) as total_sold
    FROM large_dataset
    GROUP BY product_id
  )
SELECT 
  ct.customer_id,
  ct.total_spent,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ld.product_id) as products_purchased
FROM customer_totals ct
JOIN large_dataset ld ON ct.customer_id = ld.customer_id
GROUP BY ct.customer_id, ct.total_spent
ORDER BY ct.total_spent DESC;
```

### 5.2 필터링 최적화

```sql
-- 비효율적: 후반부에서 필터링
WITH all_orders AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount,
    status
  FROM orders  -- 전체 데이터를 가져옴
),
filtered_orders AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM all_orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'  -- 나중에 필터링
    AND status = 'COMPLETED'
)
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount)
FROM filtered_orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- 효율적: 초기에 필터링
WITH filtered_orders AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    amount
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'  -- 먼저 필터링
    AND status = 'COMPLETED'
)
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  SUM(amount) as total_amount
FROM filtered_orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 5.3 컬럼 선택 최적화

```sql
-- 비효율적: 불필요한 컬럼 포함
WITH customer_data AS (
  SELECT *  -- 모든 컬럼 선택
  FROM customers
  WHERE registration_date >= '2024-01-01'
)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  customer_name
FROM customer_data;

-- 효율적: 필요한 컬럼만 선택
WITH customer_data AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    customer_name
  FROM customers
  WHERE registration_date >= '2024-01-01'
)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  customer_name
FROM customer_data;
```

    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.amount) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) as unique_customers
  FROM date_ranges dr
  LEFT JOIN orders o 
    ON o.order_date >= dr.start_date 
    AND o.order_date <= dr.end_date
  GROUP BY dr.period_type
),
sales_comparison AS (
  SELECT 
    period_type,
    order_count,
    total_revenue,
    unique_customers,
    LAG(total_revenue) OVER (ORDER BY 
      CASE period_type 
        WHEN 'same_month_last_year' THEN 1
        WHEN 'previous_month' THEN 2
        WHEN 'current_month' THEN 3
      END
    ) as prev_period_revenue
  FROM period_sales

SELECT 
  period_type,
  FORMAT('%,d', order_count) as orders,
  FORMAT('$%,.2f', total_revenue) as revenue,
  FORMAT('%,d', unique_customers) as customers,
  CASE 
    WHEN prev_period_revenue > 0 THEN
      FORMAT('%.1f%%', (total_revenue - prev_period_revenue) / prev_period_revenue * 100)
    ELSE 'N/A'
  END as growth_rate
FROM sales_comparison
ORDER BY 
  CASE period_type 
    WHEN 'same_month_last_year' THEN 1
    WHEN 'previous_month' THEN 2
    WHEN 'current_month' THEN 3
  END;

## 8. 모범 사례와 주의점

### 8.1 CTE 명명 규칙

```sql
-- 좋은 예: 의미 있는 이름 사용
WITH 
  active_customers AS (
    SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
  ),
  recent_orders AS (
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  ),
  customer_order_summary AS (
    SELECT 
      ac.customer_id,
      COUNT(ro.order_id) as order_count
    FROM active_customers ac
    LEFT JOIN recent_orders ro ON ac.customer_id = ro.customer_id
    GROUP BY ac.customer_id
  )
SELECT * FROM customer_order_summary;

-- 나쁜 예: 의미 없는 이름
WITH 
  temp1 AS (SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'),
  temp2 AS (SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'),
  temp3 AS (
    SELECT t1.customer_id, COUNT(t2.order_id) as cnt
    FROM temp1 t1
    LEFT JOIN temp2 t2 ON t1.customer_id = t2.customer_id
    GROUP BY t1.customer_id
  )
SELECT * FROM temp3;
```

### 8.2 성능 고려사항

```sql
-- 주의: 대용량 CTE의 중복 참조
WITH large_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    quantity,
    price
  FROM huge_transaction_table  -- 매우 큰 테이블
  WHERE transaction_date >= '2024-01-01'
)
-- 이 CTE가 여러 번 참조되면 비효율적
SELECT 'Customer Analysis' as analysis_type, COUNT(*)
FROM large_cte
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Product Analysis', COUNT(DISTINCT product_id)
FROM large_cte
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Transaction Analysis', SUM(quantity * price)
FROM large_cte;

-- 개선: 한 번의 집계로 모든 정보 수집
WITH large_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    product_id,
    quantity,
    price
  FROM huge_transaction_table
  WHERE transaction_date >= '2024-01-01'
),
aggregated_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) as unique_products,
    SUM(quantity * price) as total_revenue
  FROM large_cte
)
SELECT 
  'Total Records' as metric,
  CAST(total_records AS STRING) as value
FROM aggregated_metrics
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Unique Customers', CAST(unique_customers AS STRING)
FROM aggregated_metrics
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Unique Products', CAST(unique_products AS STRING)
FROM aggregated_metrics
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Revenue', FORMAT('$%,.2f', total_revenue)
FROM aggregated_metrics;
```

### 8.3 오류 방지 패턴

```sql
-- 안전한 나눗셈과 NULL 처리
WITH sales_analysis AS (
  SELECT 
    product_id,
    SUM(quantity) as total_quantity,
    SUM(revenue) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(*) as order_count
  FROM product_sales
  GROUP BY product_id
),
safe_calculations AS (
  SELECT 
    product_id,
    total_quantity,
    total_revenue,
    order_count,
    -- 안전한 나눗셈
    CASE 
      WHEN total_quantity > 0 THEN total_revenue / total_quantity
      ELSE 0
    END as revenue_per_unit,
    -- NULL 안전 처리
    COALESCE(total_revenue, 0) as safe_revenue,
    -- 조건부 집계
    CASE 
      WHEN order_count >= 10 THEN 'High Volume'
      WHEN order_count >= 5 THEN 'Medium Volume'
      ELSE 'Low Volume'
    END as volume_category
  FROM sales_analysis
)
SELECT 
  product_id,
  FORMAT('$%,.2f', safe_revenue) as revenue,
  FORMAT('%.2f', revenue_per_unit) as price_per_unit,
  volume_category
FROM safe_calculations
WHERE safe_revenue > 0  -- 유효한 데이터만 표시
ORDER BY safe_revenue DESC;
```

### 8.4 디버깅과 테스트

```sql
-- CTE 단계별 디버깅
WITH 
  step1_raw_data AS (
    SELECT 
      customer_id,
      order_date,
      amount,
      status
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  ),
  step2_filtered AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM step1_raw_data
    WHERE status = 'COMPLETED'
      AND amount > 0
  ),
  step3_aggregated AS (
    SELECT 
      customer_id,
      COUNT(*) as order_count,
      SUM(amount) as total_amount,
      AVG(amount) as avg_amount
    FROM step2_filtered
    GROUP BY customer_id
  )
-- 디버깅: 각 단계별로 확인 가능
-- SELECT 'Step 1' as step, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM step1_raw_data
-- UNION ALL
-- SELECT 'Step 2', COUNT(*) FROM step2_filtered  
-- UNION ALL
-- SELECT 'Step 3', COUNT(*) FROM step3_aggregated;

-- 최종 결과
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  order_count,
  FORMAT('$%,.2f', total_amount) as total_spent,
  FORMAT('$%,.2f', avg_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM step3_aggregated
WHERE order_count >= 3
ORDER BY total_amount DESC;
```

## 결론

CTE는 BigQuery에서 **복잡한 쿼리를 구조화하고 가독성을 높이는** 강력한 도구입니다.

### 주요 장점
- **가독성 향상**: 복잡한 로직을 논리적 단위로 분해
- **재사용성**: 같은 쿼리 내에서 여러 번 참조 가능
- **유지보수**: 각 단계별로 독립적인 테스트와 수정 가능
- **성능**: BigQuery 옵티마이저가 자동으로 최적화

### 활용 권장사항
1. **복잡한 집계**나 **다단계 변환**이 필요한 경우 적극 활용
2. **의미 있는 이름**으로 각 CTE의 목적을 명확히 표현
3. **필터링과 집계를 초기 단계**에서 수행하여 성능 최적화
4. **단계별 디버깅**을 통해 로직 검증

CTE를 효과적으로 활용하면 **더 명확하고 유지보수가 쉬운** BigQuery 쿼리를 작성할 수 있습니다.
